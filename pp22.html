        <p>Prabhas made his debut with the 2002 action drama Eeswar. In 2003, he followed up with Raghavendra, which received mixed reviews while Idlebrain stated that Prabhas is so good in this film that you can watch it only for him, he is the superstar in making, and all he needs is the right director and right break.[28] He attained his breakthrough with the action romance Varsham (2004), which went on to be a blockbuster and one of the highest grossing Telugu films of the year.[29] He received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. He appeared in Adavi Raamudu (2004), the same year which received mostly negative reception from the critics and audience alike. In 2005, he appeared in Chakram, which received mixed reviews and went on to win two Nandi Awards.[30] Prabhas portrayed the role of a refugee, exploited by goons, in S. S. Rajamouli's action drama Chatrapathi, the same year. It emerged as a blockbuster and had a 100-day run in 54 centers.[31] Idlebrain.com stated that "he had a unique style and macho charm in his screen presence".[32] Chatrapathi earned him his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.

In 2006, Prabhas starred in the musical drama Pournami, which garnered mixed critical reception but earned praise for the cast's performances. In 2007, he starred in action drama Yogi and Munna, both of which received lukewarm response from both audience and fans alike. In 2008, Prabhas collaborated with the director Puri Jagannadh for action-comedy Bujjigadu which gave him a much needed box-office comeback and he received critical acclaim for his performance.[33] In 2009, Prabhas played a dual role in the action thriller Billa (2009), which went on to be a blockbuster at box-office.[34] Later that year, he starred in Ek Niranjan (2009), which opened to mixed reviews, and earned him his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.
